I was playing a drinking game with my friends.  In the course of play, one of the girls needed to finish her drink and since she still had a full can, we decided to try to make her chug the whole thing.  Halfway through she stopped and said, "I can't keep it in my mouth." TWSS.
I was at work yesterday helping load a bunch of supplies into an elevator to take down to the first floor. The girl that was maneuvering the cart lined it up perpendicularly to the elevator and I said "that is at the worst possible angle to get it in there." TWSS.

My girlfriend and I were driving down the interstate. The road was really bumpy and making both of us vibrate just enough to make it irritating. Pretty soon it started making my seat shake a little and was making my ass vibrate. I turned to her and said, "I can feel it in my butt." TWSS.
I recently began taking golf lessons and was joking with a coworker about how I’m so awesome that my score for the course is under 18.  Playing along, she says "Oh really, so you’re really good at it…the ball just goes in one hole and out another…takes about an hour." TWSS (x3).
I was showing my friends how I can put out a match by grabbing the flame with two fingers.  One of them asked if it hurt.  I replied, "it doesn't hurt if you go fast enough." TWSS.
A group of friends and I were on Bourbon Street in the middle of a terrible rainstorm that had been going on for hours.

I was walking to a club located just down the street and a female friend surprised me by jumping on my back for a piggy-back ride.  I went with it and ran with her down the street.  After sprinting for a block, she screamed,  "I want to go down! I want to go down!" TWSS.
I was at a celebratory lunch with my manager, director, and 8 other coworkers.   Several of them ordered the special, which was a stuffed cheeseburger.
